				<p>Current theories on the creation of the Universe state that, if it was created at all and didn't just 
start, as it were, unofficially, it came into being between ten and twenty thousand million years ago. By 
the same token the earth itself is generally supposed to be about four and a half thousand million years 
old. 
These dates are incorrect. 
Medieval Jewish scholars put the date of the Creation at 3760 B.C. Greek Orthodox theologians put 
Creation as far back as 5508 B.C. 
These suggestions are also incorrect. 
Archbishop James Usher (1580-1656) published 
Annales Veteris et Novi Testaments 
in 1654, which 
suggested that the Heaven and the Earth were created in 4004 B.C. One of his aides took the calculation 
further, and was able to announce triumphantly that the Earth was created on Sunday the 21st of 
October, 4004 B.C., at exactly 9:00 A.M., because God liked to get work done early in the morning 
while he was feeling fresh. 
This too was incorrect. By almost a quarter of an hour. 
The whole business with the fossilized dinosaur skeletons was a joke the paleontologists haven't 
seen yet. 
This proves two things: 
Firstly, that God moves in extremely mysterious, not to say, circuitous ways. God does not play 
dice with the universe; He plays an ineffable game of His own devising, which might be compared, from 
the perspective of any of the other players, [ie., everybody.] to being involved in an obscure and 
complex version of poker in a pitch-dark room, with blank cards, for infinite stakes, with a Dealer who 
won't tell you the rules, and who 
smiles all the time. 
Secondly, the Earth's a Libra. 
The astrological prediction for Libra in the "Your Stars Today" column of the Tadfield 
Advertiser, 
on the day this history begins, read as follows: 
LIBRA. 24 September-23 October. 
You may be feeling run down and always in the same old daily round Home and family matters 
are highlighted and are hanging fire. Avoid unnecessary risks. A friend is important to you. Shelve 
major decisions until the way ahead seems clear. You may be vulnerable to a stomach upset today, 
so avoid salads. Help could come from an unexpected quarter. 
This was perfectly correct on every count except for the bit about the salads. It wasn't a dark and stormy night. 
It should have been, but that's the weather for you. For every mad scientist who's had a convenient 
thunderstorm just on the night his Great Work is finished and lying on the slab, there have been dozens 
who've sat around aimlessly under the peaceful stars while Igor clocks up the overtime. 
But don't let the fog (with rain later, temperatures dropping to around forty-five degrees) give 
anyone a false sense of security. Just because it's a mild night doesn't mean that dark forces aren't 
abroad. They're abroad all the time. They're 
everywhere. 
They always are. That's the whole point. 
Two of them lurked in the ruined graveyard. Two shadowy figures, one hunched and squat, the 
other lean and menacing, both of them Olympic-grade lurkers. If Bruce Springsteen had ever recorded 
"Born to Lurk," these two would have been on the album cover. They had been lurking in the fog for an 
hour now, but they had been pacing themselves and could lurk for the rest of the night if necessary, with 
still enough sullen menace left for a final burst of lurking around dawn. 
Finally, after another twenty minutes, one of them said: "Bugger this for a lark. He should of been 
here 
hours 
ago." 
The speaker's name was Hastur. He was a Duke of Hell.
